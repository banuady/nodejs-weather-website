<h1>Weather Web Application (NodeJS)</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This application was created as part of "The Complete Node.js Developer Course (3rd Edition)" by Andrew Mead on Udemy (I completed this course in April 2020): <br>
https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/</p>
<p>It allows user to enter a location and will return back a simple forecast for that location. This application is using 2 external APIs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mapbox (https://www.mapbox.com/) - to retrieve geolocation data.</li>
<li>DarkSky (https://darksky.net/) - for retrieving the forecast information.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Live Demo</h2>
<p>This application was deployed on Heroku and it can be accessed through: <br>
